# Data Engineering Repository 📊

Welcome to my Data Engineering Repository! This repository is a collection of various projects and experiments I've undertaken to deepen my understanding of data engineering concepts. Here, you'll find real-world applications of data processing, pipeline creation, database management, and more!

## About Me 🙋‍♂️
As someone deeply fascinated by data and its incredible potential to drive progress, I've embarked on a journey in the world of data engineering. This repository is a reflection of that journey, showcasing my adventures in extracting insights from big data and developing automated data processes. It's a journey of continuous learning, growth, and my commitment to contributing to this ever-evolving field.

## Projects Overview 📁
Here's a quick overview of what you'll find in this repository:

**Project 1:** [Dockerized PostgreSQL for Data Engineering](Docker_SQL)

This is a project I completed on setting up a PostgreSQL database within a Docker container, tailored for data ingestion and analysis. It provides detailed instructions on running a PostgreSQL Docker container, connecting to the database using pgcli, managing the database through pgAdmin, and using bringing it all together with a Docker-compose file all within a Dockerized environment. Key elements include creating a Docker network for seamless communication between the PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin, and integrating batch data transfer from external sources. I also include an alternative method for database interaction using Jupyter notebooks.

**Just one so far!** 😆

## Technologies Used 💻

This repository features projects using a variety of technologies and tools pertinent to the field of data engineering, including:

- Google Cloud (GCS: data lake, BigQuery: data warehouse, IAM & Admin: setting up service accounts and keys, Compute Engine: )
- Terraform: IaC
- Docker: containerization
- Python
- SQL
- Prefect
- dbt: data transformation
- Apache Kafka: Streaming
- Apache Spark: distributed processing... and others!

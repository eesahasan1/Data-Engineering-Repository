# Data Engineering Projects Repository 📊

Welcome to my Data Engineering Projects Repository! This repository is a collection of various projects and experiments I've undertaken to deepen my understanding of data engineering concepts. Here, you'll find real-world applications of data processing, pipeline creation, database management, and more!

## About Me 🙋‍♂️
As someone deeply fascinated by data and its incredible potential to drive progress, I've embarked on a journey in the world of data engineering. This repository is a reflection of that journey, showcasing my adventures in extracting insights from big data and developing automated data processes. It's a journey of continuous learning, growth, and my commitment to contributing to this ever-evolving field.

## Projects Overview 📁
Here's a quick overview of what you'll find in this repository:

**Project 1:** [Dockerized PostgreSQL for Data Engineering)](Docker_SQL)

This repository is a comprehensive guide to setting up a PostgreSQL database within a Docker container, tailored for data ingestion and analysis. It provides detailed instructions on running a PostgreSQL Docker container, connecting to the database using pgcli, and managing the database through pgAdmin, all within a Dockerized environment. Key elements include creating a Docker network for seamless communication between the PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin, and integrating batch data transfer from external sources. The repository also includes an alternative method for database interaction using Jupyter notebooks. This setup is ideal for those looking to explore data engineering concepts in a practical, hands-on manner

**Just one so far!** 😆

## Technologies Used 💻

This repository features projects using a variety of technologies and tools pertinent to the field of data engineering, including:

- Google Cloud (GCS: data lake, BigQuery: data warehouse)
- Terraform: IaC
- Docker: containerization
- Python
- SQL
- Prefect
- dbt: data transformation
- Apache Kafka: Streaming
